                            A civilian whose daily routine revolves around the comforts of home, office work, and social engagements.His lifestyle is characterized by predictable rhythm of work,leisure,and personal pursuits. On the flip side ,adedicated soldier whose life is molded  by discipline,duty and commitment to service. His days are markedby rigorous training,
                            mission readiness and the unique challenges that come with a military lifestyle.In the midst of these distinct worlds,the concept of the National Defence Academy (NDA)emerges
                            as bridge between civilian life and the military sphere. I too wanted to live and experience a lifestyle a soldier lives and how the spirit of forgiving everything for the  sake of his nation arises . The NDA  becomes a symbol of  the transformative  journey ,
                            transitioning from civilian life to the disciplined and duty-bound existence of military  professional. The journey began with the National Defence Academy (NDA) exam—an intell-
                            -ectual and character crucible that tested not just knowledge, but resilience and dedication.Upon successfully surmounting the NDA hurdle, the path led to the rigorous<b>5-day Service Selection Board (SSB)</b> training—a transformative experience that delved beyond the academic realm.

                            Reporting and Screening 
                        </p>
                        <p class="day1">On the day of reporting, as I stepped onto the grounds of possibility, it marked the beginning of a remarkable journey. The air was charged with a sense of purpose as we, a diverse group of aspiring candidates, embarked on the first chapter of our National Defence Academy (NDA) adventure.. The reporting day, a canvas of paperwork and introductions, set the stage for a transformative experience.
                         As the sun painted the sky with hues of determination, the screening test unfolded. The Obstacle Identification and Reasoning (OIR) test with verbal and non-verbal puzzles that echoed the essence of quick thinking and adaptability. Each correct answer felt like a small victory, propelling me forward.
                         The Picture Perception and Description Test (PPDT) added a new layer to the narrative. It was more than just speaking on a topic; it was about revealing a piece of myself in those moments.

                             Finally ,the screening results came and echoed success and I found myself among the chosen few. A team of nine individuals, united by a shared dream, embarked on a five-day journey fueled bygood fellowship and the great spirit of collective endeavor. We were alloted chest numbers and then after a break proceeded for further rounds of testing.

                            On the second day of screening, things got really interesting.We dove into the psychology tests, and trust me, it felt like unlocking a whole new level of challenges.
                        This stage include various tests which includes-Thematic Apperception Test [TAT] ,Word Association Test [WAT] Situation Reaction Test [SRT] ,Self Description Test  [SD]

                        <p class="teamcon2"> In between these mind-bending tests, we managed to squeeze in some fun. Exploring the campus with my teammates became a mini-adventure. We laughed, shared stories, and it turned out to be a great way to relax between all the serious testing.

                        <div class="teamcontent"> On the third day at the SSB, we dove into a series of outdoor tests led by the Group Testing Officer (GTO). It was a dynamic mix of activities like Group Discussion (GD), Group Planning Exercise (GPE), Progressive Group Task (PGT), and Half Group Task (HGT). These weren't just tests; they felt like real-world scenarios, challenging us to collaborate, plan, and execute tasks in a team. The activities became tangible examples, illustrating how our skills translated into practical situations.</div>

                    <div class="srace">For me ,the highlight of the day was the snake race. It  stole the spotlight at SSB, becoming the candidates' favorite.. This thrilling activity not only showcased teamwork but also brought out qualities like agility, coordination, and strategic planning among the candidates. It mirrored the spirit of protecting and rescuing teammates. It was a fascinating blend of competition and camaraderie, making it a standout moment in the SSB journey.
